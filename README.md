# VGL-Game-Framework
Cross-Platform, High performance Java Game Framework

----**CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT**----




**FEATURES**

>-Ability to create both 2D / 3D Applications

>-Great Audio Engine supporting formats such as WAV, OGG and others

>-Extremelly fast render engine for 2D games (3D Still in development)

>-Completelly fitted for java 8 development with asynchronous file loading / writing, callback functions and worker implementations

>-Wrapper classes for nearly all OpenGL / OpenAL objects

>-Highly customizable : most of the parameters passed arround in VGL are interfaces, meaning you could implement them yourself

>-Has tools for low level memory access

>-Ability to load 3D Models in from a file using either Assimp or the OBJ Loader provided 

>-Has its own mathematics library (Vectors, Matrices, Projection, linear algebra) implemented to perfeclty suit the framework's needs.

**IT'S EASY TO USE**

The framework takes care of low - level OpenGL calls, memory, input, texture and sound loading,
so you can focus on just the game

It has a great selection of features such as

-Font Rendering

-Layers

-Colors

-Drawing images, gradient, etc.

**FULLY DOCUMENTED**

If you are unsure about what a function / class does, you can always refer to VGL's documentation
for more information

**FUTURE PLANS**

>-Web Platform using WebGL

>-UI Framework(Buttons / Sliders / Panels)

>-Better 3D Support

>-Controller support

>-3D Audio

>-Post Effects Processing

>-JBox2D ?

>-Level Editor(Far future)

>-Android support(Far future)

**CURRENTLY SUPPORTED PLATFORMS:**

Windows(x86 - x64)

Linux(x86 - x64)
